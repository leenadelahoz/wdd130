            <p>I’m Leena, a passionate Communications major with a strong foundation in the realm of digital and social media. Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of working on a variety of projects that have challenged me to innovate, problem-solve, and continuously evolve my skills. From creating and designing content to being a social media manager, I thrive on creating solutions that drive results.</p>
            <p>I believe that every project is an opportunity to learn, grow, and make an impact. My approach combines creativity with a deep understanding of social media marketing. Whether I’m working independently or as part of a team, my goal is always to deliver work that not only meets but exceeds expectations.</p>
            <p>On this site, you’ll find examples of my work, insights into my process, and a glimpse into who I am as both a professional and a person.</p>
