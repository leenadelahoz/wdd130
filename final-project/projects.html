          <p>As a content marketing intern at Attyx, I’ve had the opportunity to develop and manage content for our Instagram and Facebook platforms, helping to engage our audience and raise awareness of our services. Many of the social posts I’ve created included customer testimonials, educational infographics that simplified complex concepts, highlights to blog posts, installations, and product highlights. These posts were designed to inform and inspire homeowners to consider sustainable energy options, while also encouraging them to reach out for consultations. This example is a product highlight for a solar battery.</p>

          <p>This post showcases the most effective HVAC cleaning methods, with a design that perfectly aligns with the brand's font and color scheme. The design of the post is carefully crafted to align with the brand's identity, utilizing the brand’s signature font and color scheme for a cohesive and professional look. This thoughtful combination of useful information and visually appealing design ensures that the post not only educates but also resonates with the audience.</p>

          <p>In addition to social content, I also help produce weekly newsletters they send to their customers. These newsletters update customers on solar, hvac, and roofing trends within the industry and inform customers on specific information or tips for each of these services. There are always multiple calls to action included within each newsletter as well. Here is one example.</p>
