      <p>
        <p>I’m Leena, a passionate Communications major with a strong foundation in the realm of digital and social media. Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of working on a variety of projects that have challenged me to innovate, problem-solve, and continuously evolve my skills. From creating and designing content to being a social media manager, I thrive on creating solutions that drive results.</p>
        <p>I believe that every project is an opportunity to learn, grow, and make an impact. My approach combines creativity with a deep understanding of social media marketing. Whether I’m working independently or as part of a team, my goal is always to deliver work that not only meets but exceeds expectations.</p>
        <p>On this site, you’ll find examples of my work, insights into my process, and a glimpse into who I am as both a professional and a person. I’m excited to share my journey with you, and I’d love to connect if you think I could be a good fit for your team or project.</p>

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        <p>I was born and raised on Long Island, New York, where I grew up with three brothers, making me the second-to-youngest in the family. I’ve always had a deep appreciation for nature and love spending time outdoors, whether it's going for a walk or embarking on a hike. In my spare time, I also enjoy cooking and baking, which are both creative outlets for me. When I’m not in the kitchen, you’ll find me spending time with friends, watching movies, or listening to music.</p>
        <p>I’m a communication major at Brigham Young University - Idaho with an emphasis on digital and social media. I’ve gained some experience doing social media marketing over the years. From being a content discovery intern to being a content marketing intern, I’ve been able to use and even develop new skills that will carry with me in future positions. I’ve learned and acquired skills such as being detail-oriented, time management, and organization. I’ve been able to use my creativity to develop innovative ideas and my diligence to perform my responsibilities to the best of my abilities.</p>
        <p> I’m grateful for all that I have learned thus far from my education and work experience and can’t wait to expand my horizons. I’m about to graduate with my bachelors in April and am excited to enter a new beginning.</p>

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        <p>As a content marketing intern at Attyx, I’ve had the opportunity to develop and manage content for our Instagram and Facebook platforms, helping to engage our audience and raise awareness of our services. Many of the social posts I’ve created included customer testimonials, educational infographics that simplified complex concepts, highlights to blog posts, installations, and product highlights. These posts were designed to inform and inspire homeowners to consider sustainable energy options, while also encouraging them to reach out for consultations. I attached a few examples of some content I’ve created below.</p>>
        <p>In addition to social content, I also help produce weekly newsletters they send to their customers. These newsletters update customers on solar, hvac, and roofing trends within the industry and inform customers on specific information or tips for each of these services. There are always multiple calls to action included within each newsletter as well. I attached an example of one of the newsletters I’ve created down below. Each newsletter is carefully designed to provide value to readers while maintaining a professional and approachable tone. This includes sharing industry insights, seasonal maintenance advice, and highlighting how customers can maximize efficiency and savings with their existing systems.

          To drive engagement and conversions, every newsletter includes multiple clear and compelling calls to action, such as scheduling a consultation, exploring new service options, or accessing exclusive offers. By combining informative content with strategic CTAs, these newsletters effectively nurture customer relationships and encourage ongoing interaction with our brand.
          
          Here is one example of such a newsletter, showcasing the balance between educational content and actionable opportunities for our customers.</p>
